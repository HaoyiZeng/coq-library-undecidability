This is the Coq development accompanying the paper "The Blurred Drinker Paradox and Blurred Choice Axioms for the Downward Lšwenheim-Skolem Theorem". It is contained in the folder "theories/FOL/ModelTheory", all other code is part of the Coq libraries of undecidability proofs and first-order logic.


# Compiling the Code

The development depends on Coq 8.15, the Smpl package, the Equations package and the MetaCoq package. If you are using Opam 2, you can use the following commands to install the dependencies on a new switch:

opam switch create dls-paper 4.07.1+flambda
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install . --deps-only

Next, to compile only the files relevant for the development, run "make FOL/ModelTheory/AnalysisLS.vo" from inside the "theories" folder, this should take around 1 minute. To compile the whole library, run "make all", this will take around 30 minutes.


# Using the Hyperlinks

To use the hyperlinks from the paper to the HTML documentation, it is necessary to use the file "paper.pdf" placed in the same folder as this "installation.txt" as the links point relatively to the "website" folder. The website can be regenerated by "make html" after compilation of the whole library.
